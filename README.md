# Gridlock-Gurus: City Builder Simulation

> Team-10

Welcome to Gridlock-Gurus' City Builder Simulation, where managing a city is no walk in the park! We're a team of coders who are set on solving traffic jams, building skyscrapers and keeping citizens happy, all while avoiding total - *well* - **gridlock**.

With smart design patterns under the hood, our system is built to grow as a city does — whether stuck in a budgeting bottleneck or navigating a service snafu. From factories to public services, we’ve paved the way for endless possibilities.
