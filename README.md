# Gridlock Gurus

Gridlock Gurus is a city simulation project that models complex urban dynamics and interactions among citizens, infrastructure, transportation systems, and government policies. The project uses C++ and Google Test for testing, with a focus on modular architecture and design patterns to simulate a city environment.

This simulation offers a simplified yet interactive model of a bustling city, enabling experimentation with infrastructure planning, taxation policies, transportation networks, and citizen satisfaction.


## Features

- Citizen Management: Manages citizensâ€™ attributes and their interactions within the city.
- Tax System: Implements a flexible taxation system to dynamically impact citizen satisfaction and city revenue.
- Transportation Network: Models transit options.
- Government Departments: Includes departments like Home Affairs and Tax Authority, handling city governance and citizen oversight.
